# Game-Cube
Planning and organizing board game evenings

This project was created for my exams in “web development”. Game Cube is an imaginary company selling board games and occasionally hosting “game nights”. Site users can follow the schedule of upcoming games and reserve a certain number of seats or propose their own ideas.
 
- So first of all, they need to have one page site with a calendar of upcoming games (later it will be transformed into PHP event manager).

- Second, users should have a possibility to reserve their seats in particular games.

- Third, users can propose their ideas through the contact form.

- Forth, the site presents explanatory videos, game rules and the latest prices for the games appearing on the closest date.
