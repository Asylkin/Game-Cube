# Game-Cube
Planning and organizing game evenings

This project was created for my exams in “web development”. An imaginary company “Game Cube” is organizing time to time game evenings. 

- So first of all, they need to have one page site with a calendar of upcoming games (later it will be transformed into PHP event manager).

- Second, users should have a possibility to reserve a certain number of places in particular games.

- Third, users can propose their ideas through the contact form.

- Forth, the site presents explanatory videos, game rules and the latest prices for the games appearing on the closest date.
